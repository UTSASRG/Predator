Patch:
First, download the source code from http://llvm.org/releases/download.html#3.2.

Usage: 
To compile a file with instrumenter, we should explicitly mention the instrumentation tool:
-finstrumenter

clang -Wl,$PATCH/libdefault64.so -finstrumenter -g -O0 -o test mytest.c

After that, we could execute the instrumented program. Then the report will be generated if the application has false sharing issues.
